# Future Work

1. **Algorithmic Enhancements**
   - Double DQN for reduced overestimation bias
   - Prioritized Experience Replay
   - Dueling DQN architecture

2. **Environment Improvements**
   - Curved and complex track shapes
   - Moving obstacles
   - Dynamic weather simulation

3. **Transfer Learning**
   - Domain randomization to transfer from sim to real robots
   - Curriculum learning for progressively harder tracks

4. **Multi-Agent Scenarios**
   - Competitive and cooperative driving with multiple vehicles
